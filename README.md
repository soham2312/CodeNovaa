A Pre Final Year Student wanting to join Google. From the last year I have been working and building projects some of them are

• CodeNova(https://github.com/rajutkarsh07/CodeNova) : Social media platform exclusively designed for programmers, where users receive personalized problem recommendations based on their skill ratings and rankings which has increased user engagement by 20 percent. Users can also engage in stimulating discussions like StackOverflow, exchanging ideas and knowledge. This platform facilitates private user communication via chat, which led to a 15 percent growth in collaborative learning and networking opportunities

• FlagRush(https://github.com/rajutkarsh07/FlagRush) : social media community website made specifically for hackers. Here, hackers from all over the world can come together to test their skills, practice their techniques, and connect with like-minded individuals. We have implemented real-time chat which resulted in a 30 percent increase in user engagement.

I have also applied for LFX Mentorship in which my proposal has got selected for Hyperledger organisation.

I have also worked for an Australian startup(e-Pocket) remotely as frontend developer.

I am also involved in doing competitive programming in which I have achieved a rating of 1443(specialist) on codeforces(https://codeforces.com/profile/utkarsh_raj_13) and 1703(3 star) on codechef(https://www.codechef.com/users/utkarsh_coder7).

I am very much impressed by how Google shaping the world in each domain whether it being Google Pay making the UPI payments easy to use or Google Cloud helping

firms to manage their data on cloud. I strongly feel that Google is the place where I can make the best use of my skils and make a good impact in the technology.

### Social Media Community for Programmers

This platform is designed to help programmers level up their CP/DSA (Competitive Programming/Data Structures and Algorithms) skills by providing a comprehensive set of features. Whether you're a beginner looking to improve your problem-solving abilities or an experienced programmer seeking new challenges, our platform has something for everyone.

### Problem Faced

As a programmer, you may have encountered the following challenges:

* Time-consuming search: It can be frustrating and time-consuming to visit multiple platforms, such as GFG, Codeforces, and Leetcode, to find suitable practice questions that match your skill level.
* Difficulty selection: Finding questions that are appropriately challenging can be a struggle. It's common to end up with questions that are either too easy or too difficult, hindering your progress.
* Lack of motivation: Without a structured approach to practice and improvement, it's easy to lose motivation and struggle to make consistent progress.

### Our Solution

Our platform aims to address these challenges and provide an efficient solution for programmers looking to enhance their skills. Here's how our platform helps you:

* Centralized practice questions: Instead of visiting multiple platforms, you can access practice questions from various sources, including Codeforces, Leetcode, and more, all in one place. Say goodbye to switching between websites and wasting time.
* Skill-level recommendations: Our platform incorporates machine learning scripts and Python libraries to recommend practice questions based on your current skill level. By considering factors such as ratings, tags, and more, we ensure that the questions provided are suitable for your growth as a programmer.
* Interactive features: In addition to practice questions, our platform offers a range of interactive features, including discussion forums, chat rooms (limited to friends), and user profiles. These features enable you to connect with fellow programmers, engage in meaningful discussions, and build a strong coding community.
