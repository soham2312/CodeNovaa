Hey Myself Utkarsh Raj, 
A Pre Final Year Student wanting to join Google. From the last year I have been working and building projects some of them are

• CodeNova(https://github.com/rajutkarsh07/CodeNova) : Social media platform exclusively designed for programmers, where users receive personalized problem recommendations based on their skill ratings and rankings which has increased user engagement by 20 percent. Users can also engage in stimulating discussions like StackOverflow, exchanging ideas and knowledge. This platform facilitates private user communication via chat, which led to a 15 percent growth in collaborative learning and networking opportunities

• FlagRush(https://github.com/rajutkarsh07/FlagRush) : social media community website made specifically for hackers. Here, hackers from all over the world can come together to test their skills, practice their techniques, and connect with like-minded individuals. We have implemented real-time chat which resulted in a 30 percent increase in user engagement.

I have also applied for LFX Mentorship in which my proposal has got selected for Hyperledger organisation.

I have also worked for an Australian startup(e-Pocket) remotely as frontend developer.

I am also involved in doing competitive programming in which I have achieved a rating of 1443(specialist) on codeforces(https://codeforces.com/profile/utkarsh_raj_13) and 1703(3 star) on codechef(https://www.codechef.com/users/utkarsh_coder7).

I am very much impressed by how Google shaping the world in each domain whether it being Google Pay making the UPI payments easy to use or Google Cloud helping

firms to manage their data on cloud. I strongly feel that Google is the place where I can make the best use of my skils and make a good impact in the technology.
